                        Dondra Lighthouse was made in the era when Sri Lanka was a colony. This could be understood by the way of its construction. This building is very tall and you will get a very good view of the nearby surrounding areas when you stand on the top of it. This looks beautiful because of the rows of palm trees that are there across the building and also because it seems as if the top of this building is meeting the sky.
